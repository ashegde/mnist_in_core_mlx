# mnist-in-core-mlx

This repo contains some basic code for classification with the MNIST dataset using core MLX.
Note, that the file mnist.py is borrowed entirely from https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/blob/main/mnist/mnist.py.

The code can be run via command line by ```python fit_model.py```. The corresponding output looks like:
